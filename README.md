# Anomaly Detection in Cricket Scores

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to detect anomalies in cricket scores using the Isolation Forest algorithm from the Scikit-learn library. The dataset includes scores from various overs, and the goal is to identify unusual score values that could indicate anomalies.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed, and then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

For running this project in Google Colab, no installation is necessary as the required libraries are pre-installed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Run the provided Python script in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
3. The script will generate random cricket scores, apply the Isolation Forest algorithm, and visualize the results.

## Data Description

- **Overs**: Number of overs in a cricket match (integer).
- **Scores**: Runs scored in the respective overs (integer).
- **Row_Number**: A sequential identifier for each entry (integer).

A sample of the dataset is provided, including both original and randomly generated scores.

## Model Implementation

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - The dataset is created with fixed overs and scores, along with random scores for demonstration.
   
2. **Anomaly Detection**: 
   - The Isolation Forest model is trained on the scores to identify anomalies. The model parameters include:
     - `n_estimators`: Number of base estimators in the ensemble.
     - `contamination`: The proportion of observations identified as anomalies.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Anomalies are detected and stored in the DataFrame.

## Visualization

The project includes various visualizations to help understand the data and the results:

- **Scatter Plot**: Displays scores with anomalies highlighted.
- **Histogram**: Shows the distribution of scores with a threshold line.
- **Box Plot**: Visualizes the spread and outliers in the scores.

## Results

After running the model, the output includes:

- Total anomalies detected.
- Descriptive statistics of the scores, including mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.

Example output:

```
Total anomalies detected: 28 
Descriptive Statistics:
count    150.000000
mean      37.973333
std       21.507591
min        1.000000
25%       20.000000
50%       36.500000
75%       56.000000
max       79.000000
```
